A PowerPoint Add-In to export the current slide in high resolution (150, 300 &amp; 600 dpi)

Sometimes you want to share the stuff you produced in PowerPoint with others. Be it for a book our journal article, hand on a figure to a collegue etc. Taking a screenshot or using PowerPoints iternal export functionality often does not give you the control over the quality of the exported slide you want.

Since I ran quite often into such situations, I wrote a primitve Add-In to export the current slide to 150, 300, 600 dpi or any other resolution you like.

## How to use it

After installing the Add-In the "Slide 2 PNG" button appears under the "Add-In" ribbon:

Clicking this button activates an input box for defining the width of the exported slide. You can enter any resolution you like, corresponding resolution for 150 (default), 300 and 600 dpi are shown ontop the inputbox. Hitting "OK" starts the export process. After successfully writing this export file a confirmation dialog is shown:
