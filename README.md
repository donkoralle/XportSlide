A PowerPoint Add-In to export the current slide in high resolution (150, 300 &amp; 600 dpi)

Sometimes you want to share the stuff you produced in PowerPoint with others. Be it for a book our journal article, hand on a figure to a collegue etc. Taking a screenshot or using PowerPoints iternal export functionality often does not give you the control over the quality of the exported slide you want.

Since I ran quite often into such situations, I wrote a primitve Add-In to export the current slide to 150, 300, 600 dpi or any other resolution you like.
